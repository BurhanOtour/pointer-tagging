# Introduction

Pointer tagging is a mechanism for embedding a tag/ flag in the value of a pointer type (an address). 

The tag value makes use of the un-used LSB in the address value exploiting the fact of data alignment in 64_86X computer architecture. 

This mechanism is part of my master thesis work.
